# About Application

COVID-19 Application, created for [Codempire](https://codempire.io/) by Volodymyr Kravets, which shows statistic by countries.

## Technologies

1. React to create application;
2. TypeScript to write more effective any structured code;
3. Redux Toolkit to easily manage state;
4. SCSS to create styles;
5. Axios to get data from API;

### Preview

To run this application:
Open [Github Pages](https://voltailor.github.io/COVID-19-Statistic/) to view it in the browser.

There are some problems with API, because it refreshes every 20-30min. If you see infinite loading, please check console and wait a few minutes.

### Details

This app may contain some syntax problems, because I used TypeScript second time in my life. But I learn new information and improve my knowledge every day.
